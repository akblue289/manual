1. Quick Recap using GAPDH hmm search
-Take GAPDH( glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) protein sequences and search against
human and E. coli protein data for the homologs.
-You can output the data in two other formats.
clustalo -i GAPDH.fasta -o GAPDH.clu -v
hmmbuild GAPDH.hmm GAPDH.clu
hmmsearch GAPDH.hmm Refseq_HS.fasta > GAPDH_HS_Out
hmmsearch -o hmm.output1.txt --tblout hmm.tab.txt GAPDH.hmm Refseq_HS.fasta
hmmsearch -o hmm.output2.txt --domtblout hmm.domtbl.txt GAPDH.hmm Refseq_HS.fasta

2. Against bacterial database: Streptomyces coelicolor has multiple flavohemoglobins

3. phmmer and jackhmmer
Single sequence protein queries using phmmer
phmmer GlobinBeta.fasta Refseq_HS.fasta > phmmer_Out
jackhmmer GlobinBeta.fasta Refseq_HS.fasta > jackhmmer_Out
Perform with another example:
Use commandline blastp to contrast

4. hmmemit- sample sequences from a profile
hmmemit [ options ] hmmfile
hmmemit -o emitseq Globins.hmm
hmmemit -o emitseq5 -N 5 Globins.hmm
5. hmmalign: make multiple sequence alignment using a profile

hmmalign globins4.hmm globins.fa > OutFile
The output of this is a Stockholm format multiple alignment file.
7. Pfam-A
head -1000 Pfam-A.hmm > FileInfo
Count the number of entries in the file:
grep "//" Pfam-A.hmm|wc
19632 profiles are present in Pfam-A.hmm
grep "NAME" Pfam-A.hmm|wc
grep "^ACC" Pfam-A.hmm|wc
For example, from a Pfam seed alignment flatfile Pfam-A.seed , you can do
hmmbuild Pfam-A.hmm Pfam-A.seed

hmmpress: prepare profile database for hmmscan
hmmpress Pfam-A.hmm
hmmstat: show summary statistics for a profile file
The hmmstat program is a utility that summarizes the content of a profile database.
hmmstat Pfam-A.hmm > Pfam_Profiles
page 48 describes the headers of the table
hmmfetch: retrieve profile(s) from a profile file
By profile name:
hmmfetch Pfam-A.hmm Calmodulin_bind > Prof_Name.hmm
By profile accession:
hmmfetch Pfam-A.hmm PF07887.14 > Prof_Accession.hmm
hmmscan: search sequence against profile database
hmmscan Pfam-A.hmm YP_009724390 > Glycoprotein_Out
hmmscan Pfam-A.hmm Cov2_proteins.fasta > Cov2_Out
